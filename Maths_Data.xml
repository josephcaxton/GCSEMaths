The length of a rectangle is eight feet longer than its width: L = W + 8 
The perimeter is the total distance around the rectangle: 
 236 = W + L + W + L 
 236 = 2L + 2W 
 Substitute L = W + 8 and solve: 
 236 = 2(W + 8) + 2W 
 236 = 2W + 16 + 2W 
 236 = 4W + 16

  π x r2 = 38.5  
               r2 = 38.5/π  
              r2    = 1225/100

 Breath (b) of the rectangle shaped park = 20m  
 Whole distance covered by Mr David in one round = perimeter of the park  
 First, calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park  
      = 2 x (l + b)  
       = 2 x (50 m + 20 m)  
         = 140 m  
 The space covered by Mr. David in one round is 140 m

 So 80% of the price = £45.60  
 So 1% of the price = £45.60 ÷ 80 = £0.57  
 So 100% of the price = £0.57 × 100 = £57.  
 So the non-sale price of the boots was £57.| > </Question>±

 5/6 = (5 x 6)/(6 x 6) = 30/36     
 19/36     
 7/12 = (7 x 3)/(12 x 3) = 21/36     
 13/18 = (13 x 2)/(18 x 2) = 26/36      
 So the smallest fraction is 19/36 | > </Question>±

 First multiply 12 and 9 then place the decimal according to the number of digits after the decimal in both the numbers.     
 i.e. in 0.00009 there are 5 digits after the decimal but no digits after the decimal in 12 so in multiplication, there must be 5 digits after the decimal.| > </Question>±

In the second year, the interest paid is 7% of £513.60 = 0.07 × 513.60 = £35.952   
So the balance at the end of the second year is £513.60 + £35.952 = £549.552   
In the third year, the interest paid is 7% of £549.552 = £38.46864   
So, the balance at the end of the third year is £549.552 + £38.46864 = £588.02 

Alternative method                      480 x (1.07)3 = £588.02| > </Question>±

 Since the perimeter of the triangle is at least 61 cm,   
 x + 3x + (3x - 2) ≥ 61   
  7x - 2 ≥ 61   
   7x ≥ 63

 Slope of line AB is :  
 m =  (1 - 2)/(4 + 2)  
 m = - 1/6  
 So, the equation of the line AB is:   
 y = -1/6x + c  
 Substitute (-2,2) into equation, giving 2 = 1/3 + c, giving us c = 5/3

If the length of the cuboid is 6x, breadth is 5x and height is 4x respectively
Surface area of cuboid = 2(lb + bh + lh) sq units
        33300  =   2(30 x 2 + 20 x 2 + 24 x 2 )
        33300 = 148 x 2
           x2   = 33300/148 = 225
           x = 15  
Length = 6x = 90 cm, breadth = 5x = 75 cm and height = 4x = 60 cm  
  
So, the volume of the cuboid = length x breadth x height  
                                                     = 90 x 75 x 60  
                                                     = 405000 cubic cm | > </Question>±

Let 'a' be one side of the cube.
Surface area = 6 x a x a
6 a2 = 600
a2 = 100
 a = 10 m
So, volume = a3
Therefore, the volume = 1000 m3| > </Question>±
